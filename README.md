# Discovery Week (Working Title)
**Decentralised planning for the Freshmore experience**

Do let us know if you can think of a better name for this event! That's why it's still a working title.

## What is this?
SUTD organises 'Discovery Week', an initiative meant to help transition our incoming Freshmores into what SUTD culture and life is like. Last year was planned in a bit of a rush. This year we won't make that same mistake again.

Every year Freshmores are bombarded with activities during their first Term here. This is an effort to help give them a concept of what would be interesting to them personally and how to take part in these activities.

## How to help
We intend to organise this in as decentralised a manner as possible, choosing mostly to maintain the conceptual integrity of what 'Discovery Week' should be like. Namely, to **provide emphasis on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD's ecosystem**.

You will find that we need many hands to help build up this ecosystem! But fret not, it's really just consolidating what you've been doing for previous year during a protected time to really induct our incoming batches.
