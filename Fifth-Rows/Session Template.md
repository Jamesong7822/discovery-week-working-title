## Speakers/Workshop facilitators
Share with us the background of your facilitators to provide some context for your participants.

Your participants may want to prepare some questions regarding your SUTD experience so far.

**Let us have an example here**
# Cloud Study Jam in SUTD
In collaboration with Google Cloud, we will be conducting a Cloud Study Jam to introduce members of the SUTD community to the basics of using Google Cloud Platform tools for Data, ML and AI.

**Brought to you by ISTD**

# What to expect
This will be a half-day workshop intended to introduce students to using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools for *data* and *machine-learning* related tasks, and is open to all members of the SUTD community.

At the event we will give you a link for free QwikLabs access. That makes you eligible for additional free access for up to 30 days after you complete live workshop session (we will be going through the first 4 hours of Baseline: Data, ML, AI quest on QwikLabs). Complete all labs in the quest and earn a Google-hosted badge for your online profile, and additional 30 days access to the training platform to compete any labs you want.
