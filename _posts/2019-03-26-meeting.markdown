Met with Chin Wei, organiser of the upcoming Learning Workshop/Journey session.

**Objective** of workshop is to imbue students with a growth mindset and the right sort of attitude to approach challenges in SUTD. Not just academic but also the opportunities here.
Previous years involved a 1.5h sesssion to share about growth mindset/ attitudes that will help one make the most of SUTD. they intend to have profs to do simulation exercises with the freshmores and put them to roleplay situations where the right mindset can help them overcome/ make the most of their opportunity.

**Points of alignment**
Looking for ways to better engage students. Suggested having videos/ interaction with students who managed to overcome challenges/ do meaningful work in SUTD. We could have students that, through these meaningful experiences, arrive at sufficient expertise to run workshops during Discovery Week to record/present about this experience in a short 1 min video and let them promote their session during the Learning Workshop.

We will continue the conversation as planning continues. We'll need to request Chin Wei to send us his material so that we can provide some synergy throughout the rest of the programme. eg. material on how one might overcome introversion could be put in the Human Library short description to encourage freshmores to come for the event
