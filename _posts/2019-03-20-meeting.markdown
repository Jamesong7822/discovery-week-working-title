**Objective** was to clarify some finer points of the proposal and confirm on budget request.

1. Registrar will check the budget for us, he's quite open to it, just propose that we push back the supper time to 7 to make sure that we cater to those who are fasting.

2. Next Wednesday he will engage all the pillars including HASS. I told him we want them for both human library and to run mock pillar classes. Iâ€™ll prep a presentation for that and will bring in the pillar reps to this group soon

3. Open to have eventyay be our platform

4. Arrange meeting with Chin wei on what the learning workshop/journey will be like for the Freshmores
