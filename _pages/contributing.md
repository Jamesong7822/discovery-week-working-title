**Overall Contribution Workflow**

1. Submit a proposal through Github Issues on our master repository
2. We will reply to your issue and review it.
3. Once it is reviewed and cleared, you will get a notification.
4. If you're proposing a session for the event, please proceed to [Eventyay](https://eventyay.com/e/80f9d561/cfs/) to submit your proposal. This is done to collate your details and to get ready to schedule you for the event. Otherwise, if you're making a suggestion for improvement, the workflow will diverge and tailor to the idea given.

*We are also looking for people to join our team to work on the Human Library, Lightning Talks, Visual branding and overall event management. (see below)*

**I would like to make a suggestion**

1. Go to our [issue](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/discovery-week-working-title/issues/new/choose) templates
2. Click on "Get started" under Feedback for OrgComm
3. Let us know how we can do better!

**I would like to speak for Lightning talks**

So what's a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)?
Lightning talks are designed to be short presentations between five and ten minutes long, but are usually capped at five minutes
1. Go to our [issue](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/discovery-week-working-title/issues/new/choose) templates
2. Click on "Get started" under Lightning Talk Proposal
3. Let us know your Session Title, a short Abstract, who you are, what participants should take away from your session and if you need any special logistics

**I would like to hold a session**

If you're a Fifth Row leader, a Senior or alumni and would like to hold a workshop for Freshmores.

1. Go to our [issue](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/discovery-week-working-title/issues/new/choose) templates
2. Click on "Get started" under Session Proposal
3. Please provide us the details of your session. We would like to emphasise that we would like you to *italicise* the specific skills/takeaways from your session.

For examples of other workshops that are pretty good, take a look at the recent [Deep Learning Workshop](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/deeplearning-workshop-2019).

**I would like to be a part of the team**

For visual branding:
We've requested for a budget! Since we're a design school, our efforts need to not just be conceptually sound but aesthetically pleasing. To alleviate the work, possibly looking at seeking freelancers to prepare material.
1. assist session organisers to maintain a consistent visual brand throughout the event
2. produce graphics for curated tracks and programs


For Human Library and Lightning Talks:
Because we are not insane, we would start work officially from 5th May onwards, giving us about 3 weeks to Discovery Week.
1. Communications: From the time you join until 5th May, the core team will be working on communicating with SUTD staff to prepare for sessions. You will be required to keep track of the conversation as we go so that we can start work once 5th May arrives.
2. Commitment: You will need to be able to commit to coming down to SUTD on 23rd or 29th May depending on which event you commit to so as to ensure smooth running of the event.
